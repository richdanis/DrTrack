# Choose the number of pixels for the smaller side of the image.
# If pixel = -1, the whole cut image will be used. Set to 500 for debugging purposes.

# Number of cuts for each image (only relevant if pixel = -1).
# Here one cut refers to a segment of the image that is cut out.
# The total number of cuts is cuts_x * cuts_y.
