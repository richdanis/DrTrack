# Description: Parameters for the optimal transport for tracking

# Cost parameters
alpha: 0.5 # position
beta: None # None means 1-alpha
gamma: 0.0 # None means alpha * 0.5
use_nr_cells: True # True means use nr_cells in the loss function
embedding_dist: euclid # cosine or euclid

# Solver params (the sinkhorn algorithm will then execute max_iterations/10 many outer loop iterations)
max_iterations: 10000

# Geometry params
relative_epsilon: 0.005 # "default" or float

# Print losses
print_convergence: true
print_scaling: false

# Problem params - these indicate how much mass is allowed to be lost and gained in the transport (unbalancedness)
# The more movement, the lower the tau should be.
# Tau of 1 corresponds to the balanced case.
tau_a: 0.99
tau_b: 0.99

# Save embedding dataframes
save_embedding_df: false
