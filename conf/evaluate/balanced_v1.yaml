# Description: Configuration file for evaluation of unbalancedness experiment

# Option to cut out a part of the simulated image - whole image is always (0,0) to (500,500)
# This is useful for introducing unbalancedness. The cutout parameters determine the margin
cutout_image: false

# Set which frames should be processed - there cannot be more frames than the number of frames from the paired embeddings!
# Often frames 0 and 1 are not used for evaluation, because the simulation is still starting up. See plots of simulations.
frames: [6, 7, 8, 9] #need to be <= 8 frames for 1848 droplets sim, <= 9 for 6000 and 20000 droplets sim

# List of results to generate scores for
result_types: ["unfiltered", "filtered", "dropped"] # Can be "results", "results_filtered", "dropped", "dropped_merging"

# Scores to be computed (see description in paper)
precision_at_k: true
k_values: [100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, -1]
brier: true
auprc: true
auroc: false # Will fail if all matches are true positives


## Miscellenous settings
# Possible to reduce the number of droplets to be processed. Useful for debugging and experiments.
stride: 1 # 1 means all droplets, 2 means every second droplet, etc.

# If no numbers of cells are provided with the paired embeddings, generate random numbers of cells for each droplet.
# Probabilities for numbers of cells in droplet and droplet radius.
nr_cells_distribution: [1.0, 0.0, 0.0] # first entry is probability for 0 cells, second for 1 cell, etc.

# Define the droplet radius. Not very relevant.
droplet_radius: 21
