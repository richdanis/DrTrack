# Description: Configuration file for generating results from ot matrices.

# Which method to use for uncertainty estimation
uncertainty_type: "scaled_ranks" # "scaled_entries" or "scaled_ranks"

# How to aggregate the probabilities for the same droplet from different frames
prob_agregation: "average"

# To let general pipeline code know that this is an evaluation run
evaluation_mode: False

# FILTERING of RESULTS
# file_name_suffix for filtered results version
file_name_suffix: "_basic"

# If True, filters for trajectories that are not merged with other trajectories. Only the trajectories with highest full_trajectory_probability are kept.
filter_merging_trajectories: True 

# If null, all frames will be processed. Otherwise, only frames in this range will be processed.
frame_range: null     

# Filter out droplets with uncertainty below this threshold. If null, no filtering will be done.
uncertainty_threshold: 0.4   

# If True, only droplets with the same number of cells in all frames will be kept.
enforce_same_nr_cells: False   

# We only keep droplets that moved less than this distance in any dimension (simulation sqaure is usually 500x500).
max_distance: null      

# If null, no filtering will be done. Otherwise, we only keep trajectories with droplets that are not next to the cut edge.
frame_margin: null
