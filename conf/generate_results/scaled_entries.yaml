# Description: Configuration file for generating results from ot matrices.

# Which method to use for uncertainty estimation
uncertainty_type: "scaled_entries" # "scaled_entries" or "scaled_ranks"

# How to aggregate the probabilities for the same droplet from different frames
prob_agregation: "average" # "multiplication" or "average"

# Range of frames to consider
frame_range: null # [first_frame, last_frame] - If null, all frames are considered.

# Whether to normalize the distances by the maximal possible distance for computing mvt metrics. 
normalize_mvt: "droplet_radius"
droplet_radius: null # If null, the droplet radius is estimated from the droplets csv file.

# To let general pipeline code know that this is an evaluation run
evaluation_mode: False
          
# Path to calibration model
calibrate_probabilities: True
