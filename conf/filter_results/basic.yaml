# If null, all frames will be processed. Otherwise, trajectories will only be excluded based on values for the specified frame range.
# Often the first few frames are not reliable, so we can skip them.

# If null, no filtering will be done. Otherwise, we only keep trajectories with droplets that are not next to the cut edge.
